# Curvature_extract
Welcome to the GitHub repository pertaining to our journal: curvature computation of image gather for semi-automated depth image quality control.

Our study refines the Flood Fill algorithm to make it suitable for application to raw data, enabling the extraction of reflection signal curvature from image gathers.
